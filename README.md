# Kanban Board

A simple and interactive Kanban board built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. This project allows you to visually organize tasks into columns such as Backlog, TODO, In Progress, and Complete. Tasks can be added, moved between columns via drag-and-drop, and deleted using the burn barrel.
